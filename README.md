# 32-Bit MIPS Processor Project

This project presents a structural Verilog implementation of a 32-bit single cycle MIPS processor using only structural Verilog HDL.
The project integrates the ALU design from a previous project and manages data through instructions.mem, registers.mem, and memory.mem.

# Simulation Files

- instructions.mem: Binary instruction memory file.
- registers.mem: Binary register file containing the initial state of registers.
- memory.mem: Binary file representing the main memory contents.
